# BooksApp
-I have built a books app. It retrieves all information from api.It saves the books 
and details in local database.App has favorites screen that we can add our favorite books.
Whenever we want we can delete them on favorites as well.

- Retrofit 
- Room
- Postman for Api testing.
- Coroutines for background thread process
- Livedata.
- View Binding
- Glide for image loading
